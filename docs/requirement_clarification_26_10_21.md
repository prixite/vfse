* "Oauth will authenticate user with backend servers that are handling the remote connections" - What are remote connections? Is this for login to vfse or login to the remote machine?

            This will be for login to the remote machine

* Branding will be consistent with the main organization means that the logo and other similar assets of the main organization will be used?

            Yes this is correct. So for example if main org is 626 all branding will match that. But if the main org is Advent but advent belongs to crothall, they will have branding based on advent since they will have access only to their systems

* Do we need to integrate payments/subscription?

            No payments or subscription because accounts will be created in different department. Once a contract or agreement is established with the customer, we will create the account and coordinate with people in the field.

* "Code will need to be inputted to add more systems". Will this be done after new payment is made? Who will generate this code?

            We can have seats. Basically when the account is created, a 626 administrator will input how many seats a customer will have (systems) and users. I would like to see if this would be feasible with a simple license generation script.

* Is Health Network something like a hospital chain?

            Yes or imaging center chain

* What is the complete name of PO?

            Purchase Order

* Can two customers have the same health network?

            Yes for example 626 and crothall can have the same customer but service different systems. Or even the same ones as well.

* Can two identical systems (same manufacturer and product) have different documentation links?

            I would say no. we wouldn’t want to distribute any proprietary documentation so we would keep what documentation the manufacturer gives. If there are procedures that aren’t outlined, we will have notes and knowledge base for that.
