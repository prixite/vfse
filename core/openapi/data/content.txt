If you operate an MRI scanner, you probably already know how important it is to monitor your MRI’s helium level. It is not worth it to go too low and risk a magnet quench. As a provider of MRI service, we've seen the worst-case quench scenario play out: a complete refill, ramping the magnet back up to field, hiring experienced engineers, and two to three days of down time and missed patients. In some cases, a quench can cost an imaging facility $50,000!\n\nTo help you avoid all that unpleasantness, we'll share when to schedule your next helium fill from the OEM recommendations of some of the most common MRI scanners around.\n\nThe recommendations below are intended to give you a bit of a time cushion. If your system is near these levels, there's no need to panic, but it is time to contact your helium provider and get a fill on the calendar as soon as they can. If your exact model isn't on this list, it may be time to dig back in your files for your system manuals. Most recommendations fall somewhere between 50 and 60% overall helium level.\nCommon Examples\n\n    GE Excite MRI: 58%\n    Philips Intera MRI: 50%\n    Siemens Symphony MRI: 60%\n    Toshiba Vantage 1.5T: 55%\n\nHelium Costs\n\nRight now, helium supplies are low and openings of new facilities to increase availability are still in progress (see more details on the shortage here). With this shortage in effect, end users are currently paying around $30 a liter for helium.\n\nAdditionally, in some areas of the country, it may take longer to get a helium fill scheduled based on your provider. If you have experienced longer than normal wait times for helium fills in your area, you may want to schedule your next fill before the target percentage.\nThe Takeaway\n\nKeeping your MRI machine within safe helium parameters requires vigilance, proactivity, and regular monetary expense, but it sure beats the cost and general disarray that can result from a magnet quench. If you're in need of a provider to help you with fills, service, or more efficient equipment, we can help with all three.

In fact, one of the most common uses of helium is in MRI machines.\nWhat Is an MRI Machine\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging, more commonly known as an MRI, machine is a device that uses a combination of radio waves and a magnetic field to view internal images of the body. The magnetic field and radio waves create detailed images of different organs and tissue. It’s a noninvasive procedure used to produce high-resolution imagery for diagnostic purposes, in particular of the tissue, organs and skeleton. MRI machines assist physicians in determining the origin of a seizure, the presence of a tumor or the damage done by a heart attack, just to name a few instances.\nHow Does An MRI Machine Work\n\nA majority of MRI machines used consist of a large, tube-shaped magnet, which patients must lay down in on a moveable table. While inside of the machine, the magnetic field alters the alignment of the hydrogen atoms inside the body. Radio waves then stimulate the atoms to create signals that produce an image. They create cross-sectional images. They’re even capable of producing 3-D images and allow medical professionals to view the image at various angles.\nHow Does An MRI Machine Use Helium \n\nAn MRI machine contains coils, a magnet and wires that conduct current. The machine uses a great deal of energy because of its large magnetic field. In order for it to use that much energy, it must be super conductive. For this to occur, wires inside the machine need to be reduced to a temperature of near zero degrees. The machine requires a substance in order for it to maintain a cold temperature, and that substance is liquid helium. The wires continuously are doused with liquid helium. The fluid has a temperature of -269.1 degrees Celsius, which is the equivalent of -452.11 Fahrenheit. The average MRI machine utilizes 1,700 liters of helium. A standard 18″ balloon requires about .1 oz of helium, and the machine uses about 56,100 oz to give you a mental picture of how much helium that is. The amount of helium in the scanner must be topped off on a regular basis, which increases the amount of helium used by the machine even further.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of helium on earth is diminishing due to its heavy usage, and it floating away. There isn’t much of it on earth because it’s not weighed down to the atmosphere. It’s slowly, but continuously, floating off into space. The noble gas is unable to be synthesized and is usually made through natural radioactive decay. Once the helium is gone, it’s gone forever because it’s a nonrenewable resource. The medical field requires a large quantity of helium to assist patients with diagnosing and monitoring their condition, which is by far a vital and valued use.\n\n\nQ: what is the liter cost of helium?\nA: As of July 2018, the liter cost of helium is about $30.\n\nQ:what is the liter cost of helium?\nA: The current liter cost of helium is about $30.\n\nQ:what is the normal helium level in system?\nA: The normal helium level in system is 50-60%.\n\nQ:what is toshiba vantage?\nA: The Toshiba Vantage 1.5T is a common MRI machine.\n\nQ:What is Seimens Symphony MRI?\nA: Seimens Symphony MRI is a common MRI machine.\n\nQ:name all MRI machines\nA: Some common MRI machines are GE Excite, Philips Intera, Siemens Symphony, and Toshiba Vantage.\n\nQ:which is the best MRI machine ?\nA: There is no one \"best\" MRI machine.
